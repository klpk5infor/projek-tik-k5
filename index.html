        <h1>MBTI: The Analysts</h1>
        <marquee>Design by: E. Terezia</marquee>

        <p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment tool that helps people understand their own personalities, preferences, and how they interact with the world. It was developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Cook Briggs, based on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types.</p>
        <p>In the MBTI, Analysts are a group of four personality types that fall into the domain of rational and logical thinkers. They generally focus on problem solving, innovation, and understanding complex concepts.</p>
         <p>   1. INTJ (The Architect): They are visionary and strategic, with an exceptional ability to plan for the future and approach challenges logically.</p>
         <p>   2. INTP (The Logician): Known for their analytical and creative thinking. INTPs are often attracted to new ideas and enjoy exploring abstract concepts.</p>
         <p>   3. ENTJ (The Commander): This type tends to take control confidently, enjoys making efficient plans, and is highly motivated to achieve goals.</p>
         <p>   4. ENTP (The Debater): They enjoy testing ideas through discussion or debate. ENTPs are highly creative and enjoy finding new perspectives on solving problems.</p>
